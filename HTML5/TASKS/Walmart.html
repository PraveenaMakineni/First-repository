                   Starting November 14, our store hours will be 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., unless otherwise mandated by a government agency. This will provide customers with greater options to shop for the food, medicine and supplies they need.

                   Additionally, our stores will continue to host a senior shopping hour every Tuesday for customers age 60 and older who may be more vulnerable. This will start one hour before the store opens. Our pharmacies and vision centers will also be open during this time.
